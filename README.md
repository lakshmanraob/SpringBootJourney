# SpringBootJourney
My Spring boot journey

I started My Spring journey With a small REST API creation.

It is about Students Video Library.

The API's developed so far

1. /students/{studentId}/courses - GET - returns all the courses the student is enrolled for
2. /students/{studentId}/courses/{courseId} - GET - gives the course details, to which student is enrolled for
3. /students/{studentId}/courses - POST - {add the Course option in the request body} - will enroll/add the course to 
student profile
